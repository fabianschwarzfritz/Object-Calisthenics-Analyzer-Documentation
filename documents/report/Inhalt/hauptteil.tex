\chapter{Introduction}
%What is the purpose of this paper? What is the content of the next two sections?
Jeff Bay's "Object Calisthenics" \cite{bay2008} are nine rules that train the software developer to write better object oriented code.  He created concrete rules out of general software principals and patterns. These rules shall be applied in a short exercise, usually about two to four hours. With these concrete rules the trainee doing the exercise can improve his software development skills, which is helping him when applying general software principals and patterns to real world software projects. 
%=== What shall be reached in the end of this paper?
This paper is divided into three chapters.\\
The exercise and the reasons for it are described in this chapter in section \ref{i:exercising}.\\


Chapter \ref{Description} describes Jeff Bay's rule and what let him establish the nine rules. It poses Jeff Bay's reasons for today's problems of software development.\\

The chapter describes every rule step by step. Within this description, a source code example is given. A bad example firstly exemplifies how the code looks like without the rule. A good example, validating the rule, then shows the advantages of the resulting source code when applying the rule. These examples are described shortly. After describing the examples, it researches concepts behind the rule. It describes the problems that would occur without the rule. After explaining the problems behind the rule and Jeff Bay's rule, a more detailed analysis ensues. In this detailed analysis, patterns and principals are described and ideas and concepts are examined. Section \ref{d:background} describes these principles detailed for every rule, step by step. In the end, the section \ref{d:discussion} furthermore discusses the rules shortly.\\

Chapter \ref{Evaluation} investigates possible tool support to validate the Object Calisthenics. First, the section \ref{e:advantages} describes general advantages of tool support. The section \ref{e:evaluation} goes through every rule and presents the possibilities to validate the given rule. Advantages and disadvantages of the implementation are explained and a short conclusion of every rule is drawn. Section \ref{e:result} then summarizes the results of the evaluation of rule validation. Lastly, section \ref{e:future} depicts further ideas of rule validation and links for further work.\\

The last chapter \ref{Prototype} describes a prototypical implementation done during this research. The prototype shows the practicability of the evaluation results.

\section{Exercising Better Object Oriented Programming Skills: a Concept by Jeff Bay}
\label{i:exercising}
Jeff Bay's "Object Calisthenics" \cite{bay2008} are an exercise to improve the quality of Object Oriented code. According to him, the exercise "will give new programmers an opportunity to learn best practices while writing their own code." \cite[p. 70]{bay2008}.\\

The book "The ThoughtWorks anthology. Essays on Software Technology and Innovation"\cite[p. 70-79]{oc2008} was released in 2008. It of thirteen essays discussing various topics and ideas on how to improve software development. The essays in the book discuss problems and ideas on languages, tool support, software principals and software quality. One of the paper's chapter is written by Jeff Bay and describes the rules of the Object Calisthenics. Furthermore it shortly describes their purpose and outcome and why the author Jeff Bay created these rules.\\

All essays in the book \cite{oc2008} are written by developers working at the company "Thoughtworks inc.". The company is well known for creating, designing and supporting high quality software. The company is said to be one of the most future oriented company in terms of technology and software principals. They describe themselves as "[\dots] a software company and community of passionate individuals whose purpose is to revolutionize software design, creation and delivery, while advocating for positive social change [\dots]" \cite{twWeb}.\\

%=== What are the Object Calisthenics in general (nine rules...) 
The Object Calisthenics are nine programming rules helping to write good object oriented code. But moreover the Object Calisthenics are an exercise to improve the quality of object oriented code. Good Object Oriented Code is hard to learn when coming from procedural code. Many developers think in Object Oriented code â€“ but do they really write good object oriented software? That is the question that Jeff Bay poses in his essay.\\

Usually the developer doesn't use these rules in real world project but applies them in short two hour exercises in which he designs and implements minimalist software with little requirements. This could be a Minesweeper or a Tic Tac Toe game for example. These training challenges should lead the developer to write better code and be more aware of code quality in real world projects.\\

With these little training sessions, the Object Calisthenics help to create highly object oriented code  in small projects. When applying the rules, the developers automatically fulfill many important software patterns and principals leading to higher code quality than the code would have without the given rules. By training developers to focus the rules they automatically apply various helpful and important software principals and software patterns. \\

The developer is supposed to "spend 20 hours and 1,000 lines writing code that conforms 100 "\%"  to these rules" \cite[p. 80]{oc2008}. He is convinced the developer will "break old habits" \cite[p. 80]{oc2008}. Furthermore he promises that the exercise will change the way "that you may have lived with for your whole programming life." \cite[p. 80]{oc2008}. According to Bay, this change is the result of the developer's need to rethink and lateral thinking. By going trought this process, the developer's perspective on existing code and the way he will write code in the future, will change radically. As just described this rethinking is only possible in small, lucid projects. This is for example a project with 1,000 lines of code, as suggested by Jeff Bay. \\

However, Jeff Bay's idea is that by this process of rethinking the code quality of the code written by the developer will improve.
Of course this will only work if the developer recognizes the ideas and principals behind the rules, and hereby accepts the positive outcome of the resulting code. The goal of the exercise is that he is able to accept the positive value of the resulting code. When he is working in real world projects he hopefully remembers parts of the rules, resulting ideas or principals and concepts behind the rules. Because of the improvement of his software development skill, he is then able to apply the concepts to real world project. The result is a tremendously improved code quality in the real world project.\\

Improving the quality of software's implementation by little training sessions \- that is basically his idea. Jeff Bay also includes this idea in the name of the rules. The word "Calisthenics" indistinguishable describes the approach, the idea and the outcome of the exercise.\\

%WEG: As already said, the background of every rule is described in chapter \ref{Description}.

\section{Tool Support to Validate the Object Calisthenics}
%=== Describe the outcome of a tool validating the rules of the Object Calisthenics.
%=== How might it support the developer?

%=== How might the tool boost the speed and efficiency of the developer while doing the exercise?

%=== Say: Tool support is examined and elucidated in chapter 3.

%=== Say: Prototype in the last chapter: 4. 
The purpose of the Object Calisthenics was already described. However, in this paper the focus lies on the evaluation and prototypical implementation of tool support, validating the rules of the Object Calisthenics. \\

Evaluating the possibility to create tool support validating the Object Calisthenics is the main part of this report. It has two main advantages \- efficiency and quality.\\

Providing tool support for the rules of the Object Calisthenics could improve the time the developer uses to conduct the exercise. This efficiency increase simply makes it easier to do the exercise.\\

Furthermore it might reveal rule violations that were not detected by the developer yet. Therefore it could guarantee that the developer sticks to the rules. This is a quality improvement. \\

Therefore, the next chapter  \ref{Description} describes the rules Object Calisthenics to understand the software principals and quality metrics behind the Object Calisthenics. 

As already mentioned, the ensuing chapter \ref{Evaluation} discusses tool support for every rule.  the prototypical implementation is described in chapter \ref{Prototype}.

\chapter{Object Calisthenics by Jeff Bay \_ Patterns and Principals}
\label{Description}
This chapter describes the patterns and principals behind the Object Calisthenics. 

Firstly, in section \ref{d:problemsprocedural} the advantages of the Object Calisthenics are described. Before explaining the advantages of object orientation, the problems of non object oriented code are discussed. 

In the second section \ref{d:background}, Jeff Bay's rules for better object oriented programming are described step by step. Every rule is described, explained and a good and bad example are given. The examples conduce to understand the problem and the solution given by the rule. Furthermore patterns and principals behind the rules are explained. 

\section{Problems of Procedural Code}
\label{d:problemsprocedural}
There seem to be problems with procedural, non object oriented code in software. By saying non object oriented software, procedural code is meant. In the beginnig of this essay, Jeff Bay lists two important reasons why the object oriented approach is better than the procedural approach. He states that developers "[\dots] have all seen poorly written code that's hard to understand, test, and maintain"\cite[p. 70]{oc2008}. These  the most important ones and they are not described further. In this section I will add more problems that occur when dealing with procedural code and explain the disadvantage shortly. These problems include the missing bundling of data and behavior, the difficulties in maintainability, bad understandability, lack of modularity, missing structure and overview, and the often discussed problem of reusability.

\subsection*{No Bundle of Data and Behavior}
The operations, also called commands, in procedural code usually access multiple data structures storing and managing data during the execution time. In procedural code steps can be consolidated by using methods with output and input parameters. Methods can summarize multiple commands to an abstract step that can be executed by a caller. Therefore procedural code provides a solution for structuring algorithms.\\

But there is another problem remaining. By simply looking at the data structures, the developer cannot see possible operations on the data structure. Of course, he is able to see what is stored in the data structure. However, he is not able to see which operations can be executed on the data structure and how the data structure is supposed to be used. He can only get that information by going through the algorithm step by step and remembering the possible operations on the data structure. In procedural code there is not clear coherence between the data structure and its problem specific operations. There is no solution for the problem of bundling data and behavior given in procedural software development. \\

Furthermore there is no encapsulation of the data structures, hiding the implementation from the abstract definition of possible operations. Also, procedural software lacks of encapsulation. The concept of hiding variables, and therefore realizing encapsulation, is not given in procedural code. 

\subsection*{Difficult to Maintain}
\label{problem:maintainability}
The just described problem of the low cohesion of data structure and problem specific operations makes maintainability of procedural code hard. Source code of long lasting software has to be maintained years after the initial design and the first implementation. In old and large code bases changes are hard to conduct. This is because the cohesion of behavior and data structures and the bad encapsulation between the different data structures is low. To be able to compensate the cohesion, relatively much documentation and much time to read the code is necessary. Therefore the low cohesion makes the conduction of maintenance software changes hard. 

\subsection*{Not Understandable}
Another problem, closely related to the problem of maintainbility, is the understandability of code. As already said, the problem of the low cohesion makes it hard to dedicate the operations to the data structures. The difficulty to dedicate operations to the appropriate data structures makes the understanding of the code hard. By  reading through a part of an algorithm, the developer does not know which operations will be executed on which data structure. Secondly, when there are multiple operations on many different data structures, the developer has to remember all these state changes of the data structures. Therefore procedural code is often hard to understand. 

\subsection*{No modularity}
\label{problem:nomodularity}
%cohesion shcon einfuerne, damit  in advantages of oo zur verfuegung steht
In modern software development the separation in different modules is a core concept.\\

According to Juergen Haas, modular programming "breaks down program functions into modules, each of which accomplishes one function and contains all the source code and variables needed to accomplish that function."\cite{about}. He also states that the concept of modularity enables the programmer to debug and maintain difficult source code more easily. \\

A module only contains all necessary information and operations to perform the steps necessary. All other information is not visible by the module, it is hidden in other modules that are responsible for other tasks. However, within one module the developer is not distracted by other operations or data structures that are not related to the module, because they are hidden. 

\subsection*{Missing Structure}
As already said, procedural code is only structured in different algorithm steps. The data structures can't be encapsulated. This makes structuring procedural code extremely hard, because there is no mechanism enabling the developer to give structure by hiding information. The only way to give structure is to sort different methods in different files. But even if a data structure and its functions are put in a different file, the data structure is not hidden from the other files. The data structure can be manipulated in every other position of the program.

\subsection*{Overview}
This point is closely related to the just explained problem of structuring the program. The only way to sort or separate something can be done by using separate files. But still, this does not solve the problem of information hiding and therefore an overview is not given.

In procedural code it is not possible to put problem related data into a abstract data types.

\subsection*{No Reusability}
In procedural code it is hard to reuse code. This is a result of the missing encapsulation and the missing modularity that was explained previously.\\

As already said in procedural code, a method often interacts with many variables of the system that are not encapsulated. A method can interact with all system variables. This leads the developer to not separate the program into different parts with their own responsibility and their own well encapsulated data structures and operations. \\

When using multiple files in procedural code, at some point the order of inclusion of these files has to be determined. When another file is imported there is no guarantee that the included files does already execute an operation. Furthermore, cyclic dependencies can occur that have to be resolved manually. \\

However in object oriented software the concept of encapsulation of data structures is integrated in the concept of object orientation.  In good object oriented software every module and object has a clear scope and is well encapsulated. This makes it easy to reuse the object or module. Firstly, it's dependencies are clearlz visible. They are not order specific, because they do not determine the order of the inclusion of files, but they determine the types that are used by the class. Secondly, the inner state expressed by data structures is hidden from everything that is not part of the module. The developer does not have to apprehend other modules to change internal states of the module. Thirdly, the operations that can be executed on the object are well defined. The developer can document those interfaces to help developers using the interface to understand how the module or object works.

\section{Advantages of Object Orientation}
%TODO Ueberschrift zeigt Anfang princip oo saves us!
The described problems and disadvantages that where described in the previous chapter \ref{d:problemsprocedural}, led to the use of object orientation. 
%TODO describe history of ooo shortly. 
All in all, it is generally stated that object orientation and its related principals save us from the problems, described in \ref{d:problemsprocedural} and provides a proper solution. The advantages of object orientation are listed in \cite[p. 70]{oc2008}: "cohesion, coupling, duplication, encapsulation, testability, readabiliaty, and focus"\\

According to Jeff Bay the change from programming in a procedural way towards programming object oriented style is hard to learn. "Transitioning from procedural development to object-oriented design requires a major shift in thinking that is more difficult than it seems" \cite[p. 70]{bay2008}. 
%TODO 2 te quelle die zeigt, dass das lernen von oo von procedural schwer ist
According to Jeff Bay, however, the procedural way of thinking is still in the mind of many developers.

"Many developers assume theyâ€™re doing a good job with OO design, when in reality theyâ€™re unconsciously
stuck in procedural habits that are hard to break" \cite[p.70]{bay2008}.
Not only the problem of the difficulty to learn a different way of thinking and coding when changing from procedural to object oriented code is a problem. But also the fact that it is easy for a developer to write procedural code. The disadvantages of procedural code do not occur immediately. Many of the problems when dealing with procedural source code occur late. That means that the developer does not get an immediate feedback about the quality of his code while writing it, but realizes the bad design of the procedural written code after he conducted a change. \\
%todo dies noch belege. Ist es nur die motivation oder steckt da ncoh mehr dahinter? was sagen andere?
%vielleicht in mf's refactoring
And even worse, when he does not realize the disadvantages of procedural code, he will never change is coding style towards a real object oriented style \- simply because he does not see any advanteages in it. Furthermore when creating code and not maintaining legacy code it is generally easier to write procedural code than to write object oriented code. Creating procedural code is significantly easier than creating object oriented code in the first place. The creation and the management of objects and a good implementation of encapsulation is difficult, but the quality of these two features, that are special for good object oriented software, are hard to realize. Whereas implementing the same functionality in procedural code is significantly easier.

Therefore it is easier for the developer to write procedural code, than it is to write object oriented code. \\

Using the concept of object orientation helps to create software that has multiple advantages. These advantages are described later in this section. Before explaining the advantages or core concept stated by Jeff Bay, a summariy of the characteristics and a comparision of procedural and object oriented code will be given shortly. \\

Procedural code is more like a step by step description of sequenced commands. 	Seldom information hiding is used in procedural code. Furthermore multiple operations manipulate data, but there is no bundling of data and behaviour in one secluded unit. \\

In object oriented software however such a bundling in units exits. Data and behavior are put together in classes and packages. A unit using another unit uses the interface of the unit to determine possible operations, and uses it as required. The actual implementation and the actual data structures are hidden from the calling unit.\\
 
In object oriented software tasks that do not have the same area of responsibility are separated. If a unit has to offer functionality of which it does not have the domain knowledge to implement it, it delegates the task to another unit, implementing the desired behavior. Otherwise the unit would not do exactly and only what it is supposed to do. To satisfy the definition of a module it needs to have a high cohesion and should only do the one thing that is dedicated to that unit. The definition cohesion was already explained. Therefore the object delegates its work to other units that are dedicated to that well defined and specific task. \\
%TODO schlecht ausgedrucket
There is a third point that is typical for object orientation. The things that are represented in software have to be implemented and expressed in software. The representation can be done by a list of commands, which is the procedural approach. The object oriented approach is to have concrete representations for the real world. These concrete representations are objects that model real world things directly and bundle the behavior and representation of a real world object directly. 
This enables to separate in different models and make the models reusable. By doing so the particular modules are reusable and are simple and easy to use. 
This led object orientation to the four pillars of object orientation: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism. These pillars are the generally accepted basic advantages of object orientation. \\

Jeff Bay however enhances the advantages by "core concepts" and "core qualities" that mark good object oriented code. The qualities are: cohesion, loose coupling, zero duplication, encapsulation, testability, readability and focus.
%cohesion, loose coupling, zero duplication, encapsulation, testability, readability and focus
Bay does not further explain these qualities. In the next paragraph I will go through all the qualities and explain them shortly. \\

Because Jeff Bay's exercise was already described in \ref{i:exercising}, after the description of the code qualities, the detailed explanation of Jeff Bays nine rules will follow. 

\subsection*{Cohesion}
\label{cohesion}
Cohesion describes "degree to which the elements of a module belong together"\cite{cohesionBook}. It is a software measurement describing how strongly related pieces of functionality are. Therefore it describes how well the units of a system are grouped. When units, dedicated to a simliar purpose, are part of the same group and no nonrelated unit is part of the group, the group has a high cohesion. A module with high cohesion has strongly related and very focused responsibilities as stated in \cite[Cohesion]{wiki}. Generally cohesion is not described as an enumerable number, but one is distinguishing between high cohesion and low cohesion. Low cohesion is considered bad whereas high cohesion is considered good.\\

There are different advantages of high cohesion. In object orientation for example, when methods of a class have similar responsibilities, the object tends to have a high cohesion. All object's methods are dedicated to the one task dedicated for the object. The object does not provide any other methods and does not perform any other tasks that are not related its actual task. Therefore it is easy for the developer to understand the behavior of the object and to understand what the object is doing, when it is interacting within application. High cohesion can also enhance the readability of code, because the reader is not distracted by method calls that are related to other tasks than the dedicated one. It is ensured that the operations of the implemented methods is only related to the task that the methods shall perform. \\

Low cohesion in contrast is bad, because the just described advantages of focus, readability and easiness to understand. The cohesion is decreased from high cohesion to low cohesion, when different aspects are implemented in one class. The result is a system that is more difficult to maintain and to understand. 

\subsection*{Coupling}
\label{coupling}
%TODO use "class A, class B"
Coupling is a metric that describes the knowledge of a class about its surrounding objects. Loose coupling can be described by two attributes. 
\\
Firstly, if a class knows less about the surrounding classes and only uses well defined, generic interfaces to those classes. It does not have knowledge about the concrete implementation of the class. 
\\
Secondly, if the state of a class does not depend on the state of another state, or at least only depends on the state provided by the class directly, and not by other classes provided by that class but only uses the provided methods. 
When this is not given, the classes are strongly coupled. The "lack of coupling means that the elements of our system are better isolated from each other and from change" \cite[Loose Coupling]{wiki}. 
% TODO quote is wrong!
Because the changes of a classes or an interface, for example when conducting a refactoring, do only spread to the directly related neighbor classes. Therefore loose coupling is considered a good object oriented style. It is easier to change loosely coupled classes than strongly coupled classes. When classes are coupled loosely they are more separate and independant from each other. 
\\

Another aspect of loose coupling is the \acf{DIP}. 
Martin describes the \acf{DIP} in \cite{cc} as following: "In essence, the DIP says that our classes should depend upon abstractions, not on concrete details." \cite{cc}.

\subsection*{Duplication}
\label{duplication}
If there is no duplicated code in software, then the quality of zero duplication is fulfilled. If there is no duplication of components or algorithms, the components are reusable and do not have to be rewritten in a similar way. In some cases the component can be slightly adapted, but in the end it is working for all parts of the software that use the component. 
The metric indicating no duplication in source code is called code duplication. 

\subsection*{Encapsulation}
\label{encapsulation}
When a class or a module hides its internal state it is considered encapsulated. Considering a well encapsulated class B with well defined methods that is used by another class A.  class A can depend on the methods, hence the provided behavior of class B.
There is no part in the implementation of class A where it depends on a internal variable of class B. Then class A does not depend on the inner state of class B. Therefore class B can implement its algorithms and state management independent form all using classes. 
Well encapsulated classes "restrict component's access"\cite[Encapsulation]{wiki}. Furthermore, well encapsulated classes "bundle [...] methods that implement operations on data"\cite[Encapuslation]{wiki}. The date is then "hidden behind the specified methods"\cite[Encapsulation]{wiki}.

\subsection*{Testability}
\label{testability}
Testability describes how testable a class or module is. There is no metric describing the degree of testability but there are some metrics describing the tests itself. 
One metric is code coverage. It is and indicator on how many lines of code are covered by tests. The line is regarded as "tested" when there is a test that is running through a line of code. It is not guaranteed that every line occuring in the code coverage metric is actually testing the related behavior of the line. 
The just described type of code coverage is called "line coverage", because it counts the lines that are tested in a test run. There are also other types of coverages. These are function coverage, that indicate how many functions in the software are covered by tests. There is condition coverage and there is branch coverage, indicating how many of the possible branches of the program are covered by tests. 

\subsection*{Readablitiy}
\label{readability}
Readability basically consists of three different aspects. 
The first aspect refers to the easiness of understanding a certain amount of source code. It is basically the metric for the quality readability.  The more source code can be understood within a specified amount of time, the more readable the code is. This makes readable code important. It is one of the central qualities in software, because much time is spent with reading existing code. In \cite{cc}, Rober C. Martin describes quotes Grady Booch and Dave Thomas on statements about the readability of source code. Grady Booch describes readability in the following way: "Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designerâ€™s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control." \cite[p. 8]{cc}. Grady Booch clearly sets the focus the style of the resulting code. According to thim, the code should be very easy to understand and read like an easily understandable book. Dave Thomas focuses more on the fact that readable code is also readable for others. Even more he emphasizes the problem of naming variables, functions and units. Furthermore he states that minimal and clear dependencies make code cleaner and more readable, because it thereby is readily comprehensable. "Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. [..] It has meaningful names. It  Provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal  API."\cite[p. 9]{cc}. \\

Two other aspects are important when looking at the readability of source code. It is generally known that well placed documentation at parts of the code that are hard to understand, help the reader to grasp the code he reads. Therefore good documentation enhances the readability of source code.\\

In \cite{cc} Martin describes the third important factor for ensuring readability. Martins "step down rule" is a rule ensuring the separation of different layers of abstraction. Classes or components describe different levels of abstractions. Abstract level classes are usually the top-level entry point when calling a module or a library, whereas low level classes execute very problem specific operations. The step down rule states that this hierarchical ordering of functions exists. In addition it says that all functions that are declared in one class should all be on the same level of abstractions. Furthermore a method of a higher level should only call functions declarated on a lower level. The result is a composition of functions going from an abstract to a concrete level. For the reader of the code it is easier to understand the resulting code because he knows exactly in which level of abstraction he is located. He can therefore navigate more easily to the desired code positions. Furthermore he doesn't have to understand every detail of the whole code, but can use the the higher levels of abstraction to understand quickly what the code is doing. 

\subsection*{Focus}
\label{focus}
The last quality Jeff Bay describes in \cite{oc2008} is focus. Focus is the description of "doing one thing". Every unit is dedicated to one task it has to manage and fullfill successfully. Focus describes not only this dedication, but furthermore states that the unit shouldn't do anything more. Consequently, the module contains no operations that are not related to that task. If it has to trigger other tasks that are not related to its dedication, it uses methods on other units that are specialized on this task. This means the module delegates all tasks that are not part of its dedication to other units. These units themselves are dedicated to the delegated task. Focus is very similar to the just described quality coupling in chapter \ref{i:exercising}.

\section{The Rules and their Background}
\label{d:background}
 The instruction on how to conduct the excercise was already describe in the beginning, in chapter \ref{i:exercising}. This section describes the rules of the Objct Calisthenics itself. \\
 In the chapter I will go through every rule, step-by-step. Every every section will describe the patterns an principals behind the rules, elucidate design patterns and best practices that correspond with the rules. Each rule will furthermore exempify the rule by a good and a bad example. 

=== FOR EACH rule/subsection IN rules/subsections: 
Every rule is described one after the other with the information that is already documented in the commited work of the "research" phase: 

 - Explain the rule. Use quotes of paper. 
 
 - Every chapter gives short explanation, a good and a bad example. These examples are explained shortly. 
 
 -  Furthermore every chapter describes the software patterns and software principals behind every rule. These are for example design patterns, software principals and best practices. 
 
 - Refer to other sources to be able to explain clearly but shortly. Summarize complex patterns instead of explaining every pattern and principal in detail. 
 
 - Make sure the principals behind are easy to read: A advanced reader should not be bored by detailed explanation and a beginner reader should be able to understand the main message and idea behind the principal and idea.
 
 - The outcome of every rule is then summarized.

\subsection*{Rule 1: "Use One Level of Indentation per Method"}
\label{describe:rule1}
With his first rule, "use one level of indentation per method", Jeff Bay tries to tackle the problem of low cohesion and ensure that one class is only operating on one level of abstraction. These two problems and their solutions are presented in the following. 

The metric cohesion describes how well an object is focused and how well it is dedicated to one single task. Cohesion was already described previsouly. The principle of "doing one thing", that Robert C. Martin describes in \cite{cc}, was already mentioned in the short explanation of focus in section \ref{focus}. Jeff Bay's Rule  "use one level of indentation per method" takes the principle of cohesion which is often applied on a class level and applies it on the method level. By doing so he ensures that a method is only doing what it is supposed to do and therefore delegates all non-relevant tasks. \\

There are two important principles behind the rule. 

The idea of delgating all non releveant work and therefore raise the cohesion can be done in the following way.
This is ensuring that the method is only manipulating data that is related directly to the method. Hence ensuring the method does not mainpulate data that is accessed via muliple getter methods, other method calls or iterations. Such an access would change data that is not related directly to the object itself. Therefor a foreign object would mainpulate the data of another object \- instead of calling a method on the object. As already described other, just called "foreign objects", can be accessed via method calls and control structures like while, for and do-while loops. Therefore when accessing an object with nested control structures, the methods is likely to change such foreign object. There are two rule by Jeff Bay that prohibit such a "deep" access to those foreign objects' data structures. One is this rule, restricting the nesting of control-structures and the other rule is Rule 4 use only one dot per line restricting the deep access via chained method calls. \\

As already mentioned, there is another principle that plays an important role, when looking at the rule. The idea of "one level of abstraction", which is described by Robert C. Martin in \cite{cc}, is the other one. The basic idea of the "one level of abstraction" principle was already introduced when describing readability in section \ref{readability}. Robert C. Martin states that a method should only operate within one level of abstraction and delegate all other tasks that are on a lower level to another class. He states the rule as important, because it hard for developers to follow. "This may be the hardest of these heuristics to interpret and follow. Though the idea is plain enough, humans are just far too good at seamlessly mixing levels of abstraction."\cite{cc}. When a method is operation on two levels of abstraction, not always, but often using nested control structures in order to acces the deeper objects and to conduct data manipulation on a lower level. Transfering those operations not only results in a better abstraction, but also increases the cohesion of the affected objects. After splitting up tasks in objects that operate on different levels of abstraction, the cohesion of the objects raises. The objects are more concentrated and only operate on one abstraction level. The object on a abstract level does not have to do operations on a low level, but is using another object to undertake the task. The result in many cases is that the object on the abstract level does not have to use that much control structures do perform the task, because it simply delegates all work that is not on its abstraction level. Therefore the nesting of control structures disappears automatically. In his rule, however, Jeff Bay prohibits the nesting of control structure and therewith forces the developer to use different levels of abstraction from the beginning. 
\\

The reduce of the nesting of loops and conditionals furthermore reduces the metric cyclomatic complexity to a minimum. The metric "measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code" \cite[Cyclomatic complexity]{wiki} on the level of a method. By reducing the number of allowed nested statements the number different paths is pushed to a minimum.
\\

The following code example describes a bad and a good example of the rule. The first example is showing a possible implementation and the second example is showing a refactored example, which satisfies the rule. In addition it has a high cohesion and only operates on one level of abstraction. 
\\

For reasons of simplicity, the following java examples do not contain imports and the main method is always in the class that is used first. 
\\
The problem implemented to exemplify is quite simple: A school has multiple classes with students. The goal is to get the avearge age of all students in the school. 
\\

As listing \ref{listing:rule1example1} shows, the method \textit{count} simply iterates over all classes of the school, then reads out all students of the class and counts their number. This operation uses nested for loops to determine the number of students. A first improvement would be to use multimple methods to get rid of the nested control structures. This is depicted in \ref{listing:rule1example2}. In this example, the control structures are not nested anymore, but method calls are used to conduct the counting of the deeper data. The deeper data in this case are the \textit{Student}s because their are contained by the \textit{SchoolClass}. 

Even if \ref{listing:rule1example2} now fullfils the rule, there is still a problem remaining. The class \textit{School} is still operating on the data that is contained by the class \textit{SchoolClass}. However the number of students in a school and the number of students in a class are two different concerns and they should not only be separated but be well placed in their corresponding classes. Then the result is a higher cohesion, because the operations are placed precisely at the classes. Therefore extracting the method that is counting the students of a class to the \textit{SchoolClass} is a step, improving the code even more. Listing \ref{listing:rule1example3:school} and \ref{listing:rule1example3:schoolclass} show the two classes with their corresponding counting methods, that are now located to the proper classes. 
\\

The example shows how rule 1 "use one level of indentation per method" can improve the readability of code and the cohesion of the classes. The resulting classes are therefore easier to test, easier to understand and more focused on doing one dedicated task. Graphic \ref{picture:rule1abstraction} shows exactly this. The operations on a deep abstraction level or operations on nested structures are not done on the abstract level. In contrast, the abstract level uses the lower level object to conduct low level operations. 

\subsection*{Rule 2: "Donâ€™t Use the else Keyword"}
\label{describe:rule2}
Jeff Bay's rule 2 "donâ€™t use the else keyword", tackles the lack of understanding and usage of polymorphism. 
In \ref{oc2008} he states that many developers learn if/else constructs from day one. Therefore they are used to the usage of the construct. Even worse they learn the proper usage of polymorphism later on in their career. As a result the "way of thinking" in if/else constructs is still firmly established in developers' brains.
\\

As commonly stated, the abundant use of conditionals leads to code that is hardly readable. \cite{gof} also state that. "Like long procedures, large conditional statements are undesirable" \cite{gof}. Even worse, it leads to code duplication because the code with a lot of conditionals "is difficult to extend and to modify"\cite{gof}. This is because the deveoper does not see the usage of an if/else construct from the outside of the class. Therefore if he does not know the class where object is used, he simply rewrites the behavior that is already implemented in another method. Assumed there would be an object that had a clear description of the implemented behavior and could be reused, then this errors would not occur. Furthermore the conditional within the method could also be implemented by different implementation behind a common interface, which is the basic idea of polymorphism. The setting of the direction would then not happen when passing the if/else construct, but the method would simply call another method of an object and the concrete implementation of a common interface determines the code that is executed. 
\\

In order to increase the reusability and conduct a better separation of concerns, Jeff bay restricts the usage of if/else constructs, concretely the usage of the else keyword.
\\

There are several ways to reduce the usage of if/else conditionals and increase the overview and readability of the coding. The three ways of doing so are: early return, the null object pattern and the strategy or state pattern. These three approaches are exemplified in the next paragraph. 

\subsection*{Early Return}
Early return is a very simple way of decreasing the amount of if/else conditionals. Its goal is mainly based on removing unused else keywords. Listing \ref{listing:rule2example1} shows method with conditionals. The code also contains "else" keywords, even if they would not be necessary. When the block of the first if clause would use the return statement to early-return from the method, the else keyword would not be needed.
\\

The second example, shown in \ref{listing:rule2example2}, depicts the solution that was just proposed. As clearly visible there is no else keyword used anymore, but the control is also done by early returns. The advantage of this approach occurs when reading through the method step by step. When seeing a return statement while reading through the method, the developer knows immediately what happens. The reader of the method knows that no other statement on the bottom of the method body will be executed. It is very clear that the method passes the control and that the execution is continued in the method of the initially caller of the method. There is no long decision making by conditionals which navigate through the different cases. In contrast, after the improvement of the source code there is a clear end of the method - simliar to the semicolon or the dot in a sentence. Therefore Jeff Bay states that the the practice of using early returns increases the  readablility. \\

However others state that the opposite is the case and that the variable that is returned should always be defined at the beginning of the method. This makes use of the advantage that the developer already knows at the beginning of the method which variable is returned \- a clear advantage in contrast to the early return approach. However, when reading through a method the developer always has to remember the variable that is returned and how it was changed. Furthermore, when returning a default value, the value is initialized in the beginning of the method \- but the return statement and the return variable are in the end of the method. Therefore the developer might have to look up the default value of the variable again. Whereas when using the the early return approach, this is prevented more likely.
\\

\subsection*{Null Object Pattern}
The use of the null object pattern is the way of getting rid of if/else constructs. The pattern is mainly used in static typed language, like Java for example. When a method is returning the value null, a problem occurs for the callee. He has to check with a condition if the reference on the return value is null or is null. An example for such a null check is shown in listing \ref{listing:nullobject1}. This construct tries to achieve the execution of some lines of code only if a value is not null. However this has to be checked with an if condition. With the null object pattern, polymorphism instead of if contisions is used to achieve the shown behavior.
\\

The null object pattern commonly has two implementations behind one common interface. One implementation however contains the code in which of the if clause's body that is shown in listing \ref{listing:nullobject1}, and the other object simply contains no code. The two classes are shown in the following. The \ref{listing:nullobject2} shows the Null Object itself and the other listing \ref{listing:nullobject3} shows the implementation containig the code. Within the method \textit{method()}, a concrete implementation of the common interface \ref{listing:nullobjectoperationinterface} is returned. If the object shall be \textit{null}, an implementation of the Null Object \textit{NullObject} is returned, if not the \ref{listing:nullobject3} is returned. By doing so, the call check of the conditions in the caller's method disappears, as depicted in listing \ref{nullobject4}.

The callee shown in \ref{listing:nullobject4} got rid of the if/else construct by the use of polymorphism. Another advantage is that the behavior of the object is not in the callee object, but is pushed within the object itself with the use of polymorphism. The result is a better allocation of the behavior to the objects.
\\

\subsection*{State and Strategy Pattern}
The third way of getting rid of else keywords is via polymorphism \- concretely the state pattern. A conditional structure has the one and only task to execute an additional block of statements or to decide which block is executed. In object orientation this can also be conducted with the use of polymorphism, and this offers multiple advantages, that will be explained later. 
The use of polymorphism means, in most cases, applying the strategy pattern. This will be explained firstly. 
\\

The strategie pattern is a software pattern allowing different polymorphic implementations, that are hidden behind a common interface. Which version of the method is executed is not determined within the object itself, but the concrete implementation of the object is determined by another object. The used implementation is plugged in by a deciding instance that determines the strategy that is used. The object itself, however does not care about the object that is used anymore, but simply calls the method of the common interface. The strategy pattern is used to create configurable algorithms with different behavior of the implementation \cite[p. 349]{gof}. The output on a given input however is defined by the common strategy interface. The \acf{UML} diagram of the strategy pattern is shown in picture \ref{picture:strategypattern}. An example of this is shown in listing ???. The first example shows a method not using polymoprhism, and the second, refactored example, shows the same method with polymorphism.

%% TODO codebeispiele einfuegen und kurz erlauter.
% TODO notzen kontrollieren - alles dabei?
%% TODO darstellung grafisch strategy pattern

%% TODO nur kurze erlaeuterung des state pattern
Like the strategy pattern, the state pattern is a behavioral software pattern as well. The state pattern can be seen as specialization of it. The state pattern also makes use of polymorphism. In contrast to the strategy pattern, the implementation used next can be changed by an implementation itself. In the state pattern, the different implementations of the common interface are representing the object's state. The objects state is expressed by the concrete state implementation, that is hidden behind the common interface, which is valid for all states. Therefore a state can change the state to another state.\\

The \acf{UML} diagram of pattern shown in the graphic \ref{picture:statepattern}. The graphic shows the \textit{Context}, in which the \textit{State} is used. The \textit{ConcreteStateA} and the \textit{ConcreteStateB} are the concrete implementations of the common interface \textit{State}. The state implementations  \textit{ConcreteStateA} and \textit{ConcreteStateB} can change the state to another state. They can change the state to every implementation of the \textit{State} interface, therefore \textit{ConcreteStateA} can change the state to \textit{ConcreteStateB}.
All in all, the state pattern is a clean way to encapsulate the change of behviour during runtime. In this pattern not only the concrete implementation is encapsulated like in the strategy pattern, but also the transition from one state to another state is well encapsulated. \\

The just described strategy and state pattern make heavy use of polymorphism to better encapuslate code. They break procedural text lines into well encapsulated units \cite{gof}. The resulting code is easier to reuse and to modify and "makes them interchangeable" \cite{gof}. The interchangable polymorphic units should follow the \acf{LSP} rigorously.\\

The \acf{LSP} states that "a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may be substituted for objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, etc.)."\cite[Liskov Substitution Priniple]{wiki}. When a class overrides a method of a class or implements a method of an interface, the implementation should always behave as given by the abstract method definition. Therefore it is the principle that a subclass of a class (or an interface) should behave exactly as stated in the documentation of the abstract or overwritten method. In the result, the output of a given method with a given input, is always the same and independant from which of the polymorphic implementations were used. \\

 To guarantee the correctness of the class that is using the interchangable classes, each of the concrete implementations of those classes have to behave exactly as their abstract specifications hence interfaces. These interfaces should be well documented and provide a clear description of what is expected to be the output on every possible given imput. The documentation can then describe the speicalties of the concrete implementations. However, under no circumstances the subclasses should disagree the interface's documentation but should follow the \acf{LSP} very strictly. \\

 All in all, these patterns enable the developer to "move multiconditionals and branches to own strategy [or state] classes" \cite{gof} and by this dramatically reduce the use of conditionals. By pushing login into interchangable own components, the cohesion of the class increases. It has less if/else conditionals and is, in result more readable and focused. The focus increases because the class does not determine the code to apply with conditionals to then treat them differently. Instead it uses method calls with the hidden and interchangable logic. To engage developers to use the described patterns and to benefit from their advantage, Jeff Bay permits the use of the else keyword with this rule. 

\subsection*{Rule 3: "Wrap All Primitives and Strings"}
Jeff Bay's third rule "wrap all primitives and strings" tries to force the developer to push logic close the data. The basic problem, this rule tackles is that most primitive values only relate to their meaning by its varable names. \\

Primitive values however are variously used in software. They occur as parameters, loop counters, return values and temporary variables. However, in all of these cases the meaning of the variable is only reflected by its name. They reflect meaning, but at the same time do not offer the associated behavior. In the following, a bad and a good example is shown. \\

To explain this issue vivid, the following, bad example is given. The example used here is very simple. Imagine rolling a dice. The number, generated by the dice indicates the number of jumps you have to do. In the application the random method represents a complex process. The application however, consists of two classes. The \textit{Dice} represents the real world dice and is accountable for generating a random number. The other class, \textit{Game}, triggers the action of rolling the dice. Furthermore it is responsible for printing the results of the dice. The game represents how to process with the result of the data.   \\

The first example is depicted below in listing \ref{listing:rule3example1}. As you can see, the behaviour that indicates the number generated by the dice is indicated by the \textit{Dice}. However resulting number is returned by the dice. With this number, the \textit{Game} determines how the  display shall be displayed. The \textit{Game} uses a for loop iteration to process the data. The processing of data is represented by this loop. The fact that the resulting integer of the \textit{Dice.roll()} method is used to iterate is only represented by the variable name of the variable. Therefore if there are many different or more complex data processings, then it gets confusing very fast. How well code is understood is only represented by the variable names. From where the data is manipulated can only be determined by knowing the program or reading the documentation. This is because the behavior is not located where the data is. This bad example shows this very clearly. The behavior that is determined by the \textit{Game} is only the way of printing: \textit{System.out.println()}. The other code, the for loop in this case that represents the complex processing of data, is not determined by the \textit{Game}. It is rather determined by the \textit{Dice}. 
\\

The second example shows the first example, but re-written in listing \ref{listing:rule3example2}. In this example, the behavior is very close at the data. As you can see, the \textit{Game} now only determines the way of displaying the data. The processing is done by the \textit{Dice}. As a result, the \textit{Dice} now has to handle the iteration and the text that is printed. By letting the dice determine this behavior, which is in this case the text that is printed and the respective iteration, only the \textit{Dice} class knows how to handle the generated results. All other classes that make use of the \textit{Dice}, can only manipulate how the result is printed via the \textit{Action} interface. 
When considering more complex code with multiple operations and data sets, this way of programming would not lead to confusing code. Because, in contrast to example one, the behavior that can be used to mainpulate the data is at the same place like the data. The behavior is not scattered in classes using the domain object \textit{Dice}. Furthermore the possible operations on the data can be only changed by changing the class that is providing the data. This makes the represented process of "rolling a dice" more transparent. If there is a extension for this process, then the change will be done in the \textit{Dice} class. Whereas in example one, the change could have been made anywhere. But then nobody else that used the \textit{Dice} would be informed about such a change, and therefore there is high risk of code duplication. 
\\

The idea of pushing behavior very close to the data comes from the approach of \acf{DDD}. The idea of \acf{DDD} is to provide a domain model that represents problem specific scenarios. All problem specific behavior and all cases that represent the real world are represented by the domain model. The domain model if furthermore free of framework specific logic or dependencies like annotations or imports. The idea of \acf{DDD} comes from Eric Evans and he firstly presented it in \cite{dddbook}. 
In \cite{dddbook} the author separates between different types of objects. These are presented shortly in the following. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HIER BIN CIH GERADE TOOTO

\textbf{entity} are the top level representations of the domain model. They provide the main entry point in the representing process. For example, this could be a class \textit{Contract} in a software that manages sales. 
\\
A \textbf{value object} is an object containing attributes, but has no conceptual identity. This is the counterexample for an object that bundles behavior and data. 
\\
An \textbf{aggregate} is a collection of objects. Because the aggregate bundles multiple other objects, it is the object responsible for changes of its associated objects. It is the counterpart for all objects that want to conducte changes in the top level as well as in the sub objects. 
\\
A \textbf{service} offers operations that belong to multiple domain objects. Service objects are usually stateless and easily reusable. A service object is only used if the represented behavior "[isn't] natural to model as object."\cite[p. 103]{dddbook}. This is seen as the better alternative than pushing the behavior in other object where the behavior does not belong to or would add meaningless behavior. "Servicesare a common pattern in technical frameworks, but they can also apply in the domain layer."\cite[p. 103]{dddbook}.
\\
\textbf{Repository} objects provide methods to manage the persistency of domain objects like value objects, entity or aggregates. The repository encapsulates database or framework specific logic and libraries and provides all necessary operations that are necessary to manage the database persistency.
\\
\textbf{Factory} objects are following the commonly known factory pattern. The factory method or factory pattern respectively, is explained in \cite[p. 121]{gof}. A factory allows the easy exchange of different comain object alternative implementations and makes these interchangable.
\\
The model in \acf{DDD} as the "heart of the model", the "backbonde language used by the team" and the "distilled knowledge" \cite[p. 25]{dddbook} is the summary of the idea. Especially the idea of an entity and aggregate really coincides with the idea of rule 3. A model that is strong in encapsulation, provides clear defined behavior that is located in the domain model itself reflects rule three. The readability is increased by, beacause it is very clear wher to find which operation. Lastly, the resulting domain objects provide type safety, because there is no (domain) object that as a general type like integer, string or list. All these primitive types are pushed to their own well defined domain objects that offer a precise behavior reflecting real world operations. 



\subsection*{Rule 4: "Use Only One Dot per Line"}
The fourth rule of Jeff Bay, "use only one dot per line", increases the cohesion of classes and claims a clear separation of concerns. The rule tackles "misplaces responsibilities" \cite{oc2008} and focuses on a clear structure of tasks.\\

According to Jeff Bay, lines of code with multiple dot indicate such "misplaces responsiblities" \cite{oc2008}. If a line with multiple dots occurs, it is indicated that the developer "violate[s] encapsulation" \cite{oc2008}. Such lines indicate that there is an object acting "as a middleman" \cite{oc2008}. "It knows too much about too many people" \cite{oc2008}. By this, Jeff Bay means that an object A is using another object B to access object instances in object C to manipulate C's instance variable or call a method on instance C. As a result, the actual operation is located in object A but the data is located is in object C. This violates the \acf{LoD}. The essence of \acf{LoD} is exactly what is just explained. According to \acf{LoD} a object is only allowed to talk to "itself, its parameters, any objects it creates [\dots] [and] its direct component objects" \cite{ba.com}. These communication partners are sometimes called "friends" of the objects. They are known by the object because they where deliberately passed to the object or where created by the object itself.  
\\

The usage of another object or method that is executed on the return value of another object is not allowed in one single line. Then \acf{LoD} is not violated. Of course it is still possible to conduct those bad chained method calls in two lines with only one dot in each line \- however, this is bad practice. In \cite{paperboy}, David Bock calls this "lots of temporary object", because the object reference will only be used over two or three lines. Then it is never necessary again. In addition, according to rule six, the developer is only allowed to use a very limited amount of lines in one class. These two rule force the developer to stick with the \acf{LoD}.
\\

Before examining \acf{LoD} more deeply, a bad and a good example is given in the following. 
\\

TODO EXAMPLE OF CODE
\\

As a result of the violation of \acf{LoD}, the behavior should be moved closer to the data. This could be done by a method offered by object B and used by object A directly that is conducting the changes in C. Of course an additional method would be added to the object, but the amount of code in any class is restricted by rule 6. Therefore there is no chance that a class will have a lot of delegate methods, because rule 6 restricts that. 
\\

By satisfying \acf{LoD} the code is better encapsulated and the cohesion is increased. The encapulation simply comes from the clear definition of interfaces and the clear placement of behavior and responsibilities. Logically the resulting classes are better seperated from each other, therefore they are not that strongly coupled anymore and have a higher cohesion. Again, the higher cohesion is a result of the fact that the object delegates the work completely to another object and dispenses the liability. Even more the software is easier to test \- not only the software is looser coupled, better encapsulated but is is also easier to write mocks for those classes.
\\

The mock can simply mock the behavior in one object. A mock of class B is enough. It does not have to provide mocks for two object, instances of class B and class C, whereas the mock of class B would return the mock of class C. One mock is enough to provide a test environment. When the mock partly reimplements behavior it is guaranteed that the calss that uses the mock does only use the direct methods of the closely related objects. In this case the developer can easily convince himself that no other mock objects are necessary to make the test run.
\\

The just described ideas of mocks obviously also apply for other, slightly different implementations of units: It is enough to satisfy the interfaces of the friends of the object and it is not necessary to provide additional implementations for other objects. Hence beside the advantages of loose coupling, higher cohesion, correct placement of behavior also the easiness to maintain the code and the easiness to adopt the code increases. 
\\

For me personally, applying this rule was the biggest challenge and the awareness of the described coherences significanly improved the way I designed, created and changed code. 

\subsection*{Rule 5: "Don't Abbreviate"}
Jeff Bay's rule 5, "don't abbreviate" permits any abbreviation in class, method, and variable names. The rule permits any abbreviation that might be confusing for another developer that is unaware of it. As a result he permits all of them, guaranteeing simple and understandable names.
\\

He sates that abbreviations are confusing and badly readable \cite{oc2008}. Furthermore, he argues that a long method name, which is consitent of multiple words indicated bad code. If there are multiple words involved in on method name it might be an indication that multiple different tasks are located in one method.  Jeff Bay summarizes it the following way: "This might be a sign of misplaced respnsibility or a missing class" \cite{oc2008}.\\

To prevent the develoer from using abbreviations the restricts proposes his own naming convention for method name. However these rule is also useful for the naming of variables and classes because for those artifacts the same just described problems of readiability occurs.\\

Firstly an artifact should only consist of two words maximum. Rober C. Martin also proposes that in \cite[p. 19]{cc} by introducing the "avid[ance of] disinformation" and the "us[age of] intention-revealing names". 
\\

Secondly, Jeff Bay proposes another hint for methods names. They should always make use of the context in which they are declared.
\\

In the following block, there examples for bad method and class names are given. The naming of those artifacts is then improved and the improved names are depicted. 
\\

A class \textit{Car} with the method \textit{startEngine} can be simplified by changing the method name to \textit{start}. Imagine a car in a real world and imagine situation where you speak to a friend directly. The easy and more colloquial language would be \textit{"let's go, start the car"} rather than \textit{"let's go start the car's engine"}. This is simply because the description "start" describes the conducted action as well as "start the engine" \- from the perspective of someone using a car.\\

A class \textit{LaptopScreen} describes the screen of a laptop and is created and managed by a class \textit{Laptop}. Given this class only has the operations \textit{adjustBrightness(BrithnessLevel brightnesslevel)} and \textit{changeScreenResolution(ScreenResolution resolution)}. In this example the class names are used as placeholders for the instance variable names of these types, simply assuming that the name might be similar. Often such a variable is named with the lower case version of the classe name: name or respectively laptopScreen. However the best solution is when the variable name describes the context in which the type is used and does not duplicate the information that was already given via the type.  

In this example there are several improvements that can be done to improve the naming. The first improvement is regarding the class name. Because the \textit{LaptopScreen} is only used in the context of a \textit{Laptop}, the duplication of the word "laptop" is unnecessary.

The second improvement is on method level. The type of the parameter \textit{BrithnessLevel} already give information about what is adjusted. Therefore repeating "brigthness" in the method name is a duplication. In addition it is clear that when adjusting the brightness, there is a linear scale \- maybe percentage or maybe numbers. The fact that is is a the "level" of the brightness is clear from the context of the laptop screen. All in all, the method name cna be reduced to \textit{adjust(Brithness level)}. The same principals, that where described for the brightness level can be applied for the change of the laptop's screen resolution, resulting in a method name that might be called \textit{change(Resolution resolution)}.

After the renaming of the methods, they changed from \textit{LaptopScreen.changeScreenResolution(ScreenResolution resolution)}  and \textit{LaptopScreen.adjustBrightness(BrithnessLevel brightnesslevel)} to \textit{Screen.adjust(Brightness level)} and \textit{Screen.change(Resolution resolution)}. Clearly visible is the reduction of the name by removing duplication of intormation. 
\\

The third example will adress the problem addresse originally by the rule, which is also anchored in its name. The prohibition to use any abbreviations. An example for this is given in the next, third and last example. 

Image in a class \textit{NSString} which is widely used in apple iOS framework and comes from the programming language Objective-C. Every string in this language is an \textit{NSString}. In fact most of the base classes of the language start with "NS". The abbreviation NS stands for NeXT \- the name of the company which created the programming language Objective-C. NS therefore is just an abbreviation which is \- even worse \- only use to specify the context in which it is used. This is an example, where the abbreviation is integrated in one of the core entities of the language. Even if the creation of the language was long ago, there could have been a change of the class name to remove such a bad readable and confusing name.

Many other frameworks also use abbreviations, for example the \acf{GWT} with its class \acf{GWTCreate}. In his paper, Jeff Bay does not give further examples for abbreviations. He simpy encourages developers not to use any of them to avert confusion from the start.
\\

As shown in the examples and the restrictions of the rule, given by Jeff Bay, there are various ways to improve names of classes, methods and variable names. 

\subsection*{Rule 6: "Keep All Entities Small"}
Jeff Bays rule six, "keep all entities small", prohibits to write classes "with more than fifty lines and no package that's more than ten files.". Long classes are commonly known as hardly readable and understandable because simply the variance and the number of statements make difficult to understand. 
\\

Classes that consist of very many lines of code are hard to overview and to understand. They are likely to multiple behaviors and do not follow the pattern of "doing one thing" as stated in \cite{cc}. Long classes with many lines of code do more than one thing and mostly have more than one purpose. Therefore they shall be splitted up in diffent units with a high cohesion, focus and a clear separation of concerns and a differentiation of the levels of abstraction. 
\\

According to Jeff Bay, when refactoring existing code and splitting up large classes into several smaller units, package reveal their real purpose. Whereas classes will become unit that only fulfill one dedicated task, packages bundle those small units and provide bigger process. "As your classes become smaller and have fewer responsibilities and as you limit package size you will start to see that packages represent clusters of related classes that work together to achieve one goal." \cite{oc2008}. Furthermore resulting package provide a small functionality. The rules of cohesion, focus, overview, structure which applies for classes, definitely also apply for packages. Even more \- whereas the package might not have had an identity before, it now serves to one bigger task that is represented in different units, hence classes. 
\\

Giving and example for long classes would go beyond the scope of the discussion about code examples, therefore no example is given.


\subsection*{Rule 7: "Donâ€™t Use Any Classes with More Than Two Instance Variables"}
Jeff Bays rule seven, "don't use any classes with more than two instance variables" strongly focuses on the decrease of cohesion.
\\

Jeff Bay underlines that "most classes should simply be responsible for handling a single state varible, but a few will require two." \cite{oc2008} This is because sometimes there has to be something like a coordination between two object instances that has to be managed. Then this managing object is allowed to constist of two instance variables. All other classes that do not fulfill that purpose should only have one instance variable in order to fulfill rule seven.
\\

The rule is similar to rule three, which is also about bundling behavior in classes. However this rule tackle the problem of the bundling of many non related behavior in one class. If only one or two instance variables are available, it is nearly impossible to put behavior of multiple concerns in one class. By restricing the number of instance variable Jeff Bay forces the developer to write highly cohesive classes that focus on doing one thing. The challenge for the developer might furthermore be the problem of finding those small differences, which are rich in detail. 
\\

The following shows an example of a class with more than two instance variables. The class can be split up further to enable a more detailed description of the real world. It matches the idea of unravelling the model that comes from \acf{DDD}, beeing described in \acf{dddbook}.
\\

Listing \ref{listing:rule7example1:car} show a model presentation of a \textit{Car}. The car bundles other representations, like \textit{SteeringWheel}, a \textit{Radio}, all the given \textit{edals} and the \textit{Doors} it is consisting of. In addition the class has a method: \textit{Car.start()}. It is a very simple example of a model representation. However the method \textit{start()} lacks in cohesion and focus. Indeed all operations in the method have to do with starting perparing the car to start, they behave differently and are located somewhere else. The doors are in the exterior of the car, the steering wheel and the pedals of the car are part of the driver's cockpit and the radio is located in the center of the console.

In this example, not only the low cohesion of the \textit{Car} is problematic, but also the lack of modularity. Imagine a you want to map a \textit{RallyCar}. Usually rally cars do not have a radio. Therefore the developer whould have to implement the a RallyCar without a radio. But actually all the other structure is the same: The \textit{RallyCar} also has pedals, it also has doors and it has a steering wheel, too. Before expounding the solution of this modelling problem, the better variant of modelling a \texti{Car} is shown. 
\\

Listing \ref{listing:rule7example2:car} shows the second version of the car. As the \textit{Car} in the first example, it also has the same method. However it is only consisting of the \textit{Interior} and the \textit{Exterior}, shown in listing \ref{listing:rule7example2:interior} and \ref{listing:rule7example2:exterior}. These classes hold the references to the \texit{CenterConsole} and the \textit{Cockpit} shown in \ref{listing:rule7example2:centerconsole} and \ref{listing:rule7example2:cockpit}. The splitting of these two classes into more sophisticated structures which then hold the classes that the developer originally wanted to represent: \textit{SteeringWheel}, \textit{Radio}, \textit{Doors} and \text{Pedals}. Maybe this sophisticated structure looks like an overhead,  it becomes clear that the opposite is true. The method \textit{Car.start()} got significanly simpler and increased in cohesion. Furthermore it now delegates the work to the model classes \textit{Interior} and \textit{Exterior}. These no delegate execute the work for the classes they are responsible for. The same principle applies for the \textit{Interior} class. 
\\

Before comparing the examples in detail it has to be said that the interface of the \texti{Car} is the same for both examples. \textit{Car} represents a top level entry point for a component making use of this entity. In example two, which consists of more classes, but also in example one the top level entity or entry point \textit{Car} could be the main starting point for using the package. Therfore a user would not be affected by the refactory that was conducted. 
\\

In comparison the new model is split up in more classes. By doing so, these classes have have a higher cohesion: They delegate more work and do one thing better. However when splitting up the method \textit{Car.start()} from the first example shown in listing \ref{listing:rule7example1:car}, it is necessary to clearly name and implement the delegation methods to enable the subsequent developer to understand the model. The risk in this approach of splitting up things in detailed model lies in the introduction of new aggregate types. 
\\

In example one, \textit{Car} was the only aggregate of all the classes. In example two, there are more aggregate classes, \textit{Interior}, \textit{Exterior}, \textit{CenterConsole} and \textit{Cockpit}. Even if all the aggregates handle multiple instance variable (like \text{Exterior}), they are responsible for their contained sub instances. The problem that might occur during development is the introduction of new aggregate types, that do no necessarily exist in the real world. For example the \textit{Interior} and the \textit{Exterior} are barely imagineable, they are less concrete than for example \textit{Pedals}. If the break down in detailed entities results in many "unreal" classes, the developer should rething the model's design. 
\\

Despite the just described problem, following this rule highly increases the cohesion of classes. Bugs and errors, especially bugs that occur when working with model aggregate, can be clearly located and spottet. he separation of the classes' concerns and the squeezing down of the model results to a better abstracted, easily interchangable model. They are clearly placed in their corresponding part in the domain model and form a detailed representation of the holisitc model. The attention to detail of the developer, resulting in perfectly describing models and high cohesive classes is the goal of this rule. Guaranteeing the awareness for the described problems and its beneficial solutions is the goal of this rule.

\section{Discussion}
\label{d:discussion}
\ref{d:discussion}
=== This chapter is discussing the rules shortly. 

=== Use quotes from Jeff's text: He also gives a short summary of his text in the end

\subsection*{Similarities}
=== Are there similarities in the rules? Is it possible to categorize the rules in terms of: 
 - Do they have the same intention?
 - Are they related to the same "big picture" idea (example: encapsulation or abstraction) 

Categorize rules: Are there similarities from perspective of principle? ??? Together with next chapter?

\subsection*{Precedence}
=== Make clear that this is my own estimation and not related to Jeff's text. Prioritize the rules. 

=== To be determined: How long is this chapter?

\begin{itshape}
// Yada yada yada: 
Own estimation: what's the most important rule? 
What do I think?
What does the author think? 
Reason with descriptions and examples given
\end{itshape}

\subsection*{Conclusion and Outcome}
=== Give a short and precise conclusion of the Object Calisthenic: Purpose, exercise, stuff to learn, skill improvement. 

=== Also Summarize what most of the rules are about: 

RESERACH page 21: 

- behaviour and operation oriented

- LoD and loose coupling

- talk to friends

- talk the protocol specified by the object's operation

- Next page: conclusion, no else ,naming, 

all in all: Duplication of code and idea
==> "Simple and elegant Abstractions"


\chapter{Tool Support to Validate the Object Calisthenics - Evaluation}
\label{Evaluation}
\section{Advantages of Tool Support}
\label{e:advantages}
=== What is a tool? Why do tools help? What makes tools strong? Why do tools matter for developers?
Possible outcome of tool support for the OC's? Already described in the Introduction (chapter 1). Describe this more in detail here if necessary. 
\section{Working Environment}
=== Describe AST generally. Say that Eclipse provides types representing the parts of code syntax. This is seen as given. 

=== Refer to other references explaining AST.

=== Describe shortly how it is possible to do an AST validation with eclpise. 

=== Say that: "Eclipse" terms for AST nodes are quite similar to general terms for java's nodes in ASTs. In this report the standard terms are used. These are not further described in this paper.

--> Example: Describe that "MethodDeclaration" consists of different other nodes representing the declaration of a method. Describe the structure of the child nodes of the node as far necessary. Do not embark on a discussion about what exactly is allowed as method declaration. 

=== Therefore: Give reference for questions about "parameter", "type", "class", "expression" or "statement".
Say that the validation in the next section is exactly implemented as described. One validation implementation example is explained exemplary in the Prototype chapter.

\section{Evaluation of Rule Validation}
\label{e:evaluation}
=== Say that the prioritization of the rules (in terms of the rule validation) and the "ranking" is given in the end. The sections of this chapter are "rule specific", even if the next subsections refer to each other.

=== FOREACH Rule/Subsection IN Rules/Subsections:

 - Similarities found out in description may be similar in this validation? Categorize the rules in groups to form a validation perspective. (E.g.: Validation of rule y is very similar to the validation of rule x that was already explained.)
  
 - Use examples given in description chapter to describe the typical structure of the rule. 
 
 - Explain "the positive case": What is the positive structure, satisfying the rule. Where does a rule violation occur when the structure is not fulfilled. (Example: Positive case: maximum of 2 instance variables. If not fulfilled: Discussion Rule violation information occurs on the level of the class or on the level of the third instance variable?
 
 - What checks have to be done for the validation?
 
 - Discussion of 'rule dependencies' within one rule (example: wrapper has to determine possible wrapper classes first before beeing able to indicate the use of a primitive/string in a non-wrapper class...)
 
  - --> solution found/no solution found
 
  - Therefore: Be self-critical: Now, were a "solution" is found (or not), describe the problems that occur with the described implementation
  
 - If there are cases where the rule cannot be validated: Why is it hard to validate. Where does the validation fail? How is it possible to "trick" a good implementation (Example: wrap of primitives can be "tricked" with 'return new Wrapper(instancevariable)'...) 

\subsection*{Validation of Rule 1}
Cool, I can draw trees: 

\begin{tikzpicture}
[font=\small, edge from parent, 
    every node/.style={top color=white, bottom color=black!10, 
    rectangle,rounded corners, minimum size=6mm, draw=black!75,

    level 3/.style={sibling distance=1cm}, 
    level distance=2cm,
    ]
    \node (A) {A} 
        child { node (B) {B}
            child { node {B1} 
            edge from parent node[left=.5em,draw=none] {$\chi^2$} }
            child { node {B2}}
            }
        child {node (C) {C}
            child { node {C1}
                child { node {C1a}}
            }
        child { node {C2}}
        child { node {C3}
            child { node {C3a}}
            child { node {C3b} edge from parent node[right=.5em,draw=none] {$\frac{a}{b}$}}
            }
        }
    child { node {D} 
        child { node {D1}}
        child { node {D2}}
};

\section{Result of the Evaluation}
\label{e:result}
=== Give a summary on how hard it was to implement the rules. Where does the rule validator fail. Summarize results of the evaluation. 
Be positive: Do not forget to emphasize the good and working parts of the evaluation tool and accent the positive outcome of them.
\section{Future Work}
\label{e:future}
=== Be philosophical: What is still to be done in terms of rule validation. 

=== If many rules cannot be validated: Future work might be a software where the user can "mark" structures as given. (Example: If it is not possible to determine if a class is a wrapper class, the user could "mark" it as a wrapper class and the validation algorithm might work...)

=== If many rules can be validated: Future work might be the configuration of the rule validator. "pluggable" rules that the user can implement himself? Or "configurable" rule: Use of 2/3/4 instance variables per class. 

\chapter{Prototypical Implementation of Tool Support}
\label{Prototype}
=== This chapter describes the implementation of the prototype. 
\section{Requirements}
=== Describe requirements for the prototype. Depends on how "good" the prototype is....
\section{Architecture}
=== Describe overall architecture. 

=== How about a package overview and a short description: What do the classes of the package do and how do they interact in the software? 
\section{Exemplary Rule Validation}
=== One example implementation of one rule validation. Idea: Implementation of an ASTVisitor class...

\section{Resulting Prototype}
=== If the protype is really good: swagger and present it as a good software, that might be used in trianings?

=== If not: Be proud of what is there :). This is only a prototype. What could be improved in a better implementation? Is it even possible to do a better implementation in terms of the rule validation (depends on the outcome of chapter 3).

=== Show screenshot and describe UI. What is possible to do with the client

=== Independent form the quality of the prototype: What are ideas that are still out there for the protoype? 
How could the product improve?
\section{Outlook and Future Work}
=== Possible future work, dependent on what is said in the previous section.
